# MSc-Research-Project - "Information-Security-Management-System-ISMS-of-Hays-Central-Services-IT"


For this Research Project, the course superiors were Dr. Leon Smalov and the Cyber Security course Director Dr. Christo Panchev at Coventry University.


Abstract:

This project was adopted from the point of view of the Cybersecurity and Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Hays Central Services IT and used Hays Technology; during the Research Project I applied Two Research Methodologies in order to evaluate existing practice and potential risks at Hays and those Methodology included in these reports, and they are Primary (research plan) Methodology and Secondary (research design plan and practical Implementation) Methodology.
Elucidations can be found later in these reports.

Synopsis of the Research Project:

This Research Project is 117 pages long, which is conducting a series of security operations within Hays ISMS, including Cyber Security. These reports are being completed purely based on real-world scenarios, and on-going-operations and in conjunction with all security teams at Hays. 

At the same time, this team (ISMS team) is Implementing Hays Global Cyber and InfoSec Strategy, which means, with the Strategic Context, the ISMS team will enforce its Implementation Phase in order to reshape and improve Hays Cyber and Information Security situation.
All security teams’ activities, findings, and remediations can be found later in these reports in the Secondary Methodology and Annexes.




Scope of the Project:

This Research Project is focusing on conducting and completing research based on Hays Central Services IT, which is a Global Position for Hays 33 countries; therefore, the Hays ISMS department is utilising Hays Global Cyber and InfoSec Strategy, and also, provides Guidelines and Directions to all security teams to each region and country based on Hays’s ISMS policy.
